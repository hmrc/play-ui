Micro-library containing core for HMRC's Play UI:

### Formatters
* `Dates` provides various human-readable date formats
* `Money` formats pounds and pence
* `Strings` changes the case of phrases and hyphenates

### Form Mappers & Validators
* `DateTuple` maps year, month, day fields to a `LocalDate`
* `StopOnFirstFail` applies constraints in order and fails fast
* `Validators` contains multiple small validation functions such as `addressTuple`, `positiveInteger` & `nonEmptySmallText`

### Helper Templates
Has many standard snippets for form fields, such as: `address`, `dateFields`, `dropdown`, `fieldGroup`. Each helper
correctly adds labels, error messages and CSS classes.

### Layout Templates
Contains templates for components used across frontend applications such as: header, footer, sidebar, betaBanner.

### Google Tag Manager
To add support for tracking and analytics for your frontend, please provide the following in your environment-specific configuration (ex: app-config-development):

```
// <CONTAINER> can be one of: { main, transitional }
// main: This is the main container that contains all the environments in GA
// transitional: This is the transitional container which will eventually be dumped 
gtm.container: <CONTAINER>

``` 

### Accessibility Statements

The [FooterLinks](src/main/twirl/uk/gov/hmrc/play/views/layouts/FooterLinks.scala.html) component generates the standard list of links for passing into Gov.UK template.

To configure this component to link to the new 
[Accessibility Statement service](https://www.github.com/hmrc/accessibility-statement-frontend), provide the key 
`accessibility-statement.service-path` in your `application.conf`. This key is the path to your 
accessibility statement under https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/accessibility-statement.
 
For example, if your accessibility statement is https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/accessibility-statement/discounted-icecreams, 
this property must be set to `/discounted-icecreams` as follows:

```
accessibility-statement.service-path = "/discounted-icecreams"
```


### Integrating with Tracking Consent

The [TrackingConsentSnippet](src/main/twirl/uk/gov/hmrc/play/views/layouts/TrackingConsentSnippet.scala.html)
component generates the HTML SCRIPT tags necessary to integrate with [tracking-consent-frontend](https//www.github.com/hmrc/tracking-consent-frontend)

Before integrating, it is important to remove any hardcoded snippets relating to GTM, GA or Optimizely. Tracking consent
manages the enabling of these third-party solutions based on the user's tracking preferences. If they are not removed
there is a risk the user's tracking preferences will not be honoured.

Configure your service's GTM container in `conf/application.conf`. For example, if you have been
instructed to use GTM container `a`, the configuration would appear as:

```
gtm.container = "a"
```

If you are already using the [Head](src/main/twirl/uk/gov/hmrc/play/views/layouts/Head.scala.html) template, simply replace with
[HeadWithTrackingConsent](src/main/twirl/uk/gov/hmrc/play/views/layouts/HeadWithTrackingConsent.scala.html). If you are 
not using Head, locate in your frontend code the location where common Javascripts and stylesheets are added to the HTML HEAD element.

Add TrackingConsentSnippet above the other assets in the HEAD tag. For example,

```
@this(trackingConsentSnippet: TrackingConsentSnippet)

...

@trackingConsentSnippet()

<link href='path-to-asset.css' media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
...
```

If using Play 2.7 and CSPFilter, the nonce can be passed to tracking consent as follows:

```
@import views.html.helper.CSPNonce
...
@hmrcTrackingConsentSnippet(nonce = CSPNonce.get)
...
```

## Adding to your service

Include the following dependency in your SBT build

```scala
resolvers += Resolver.bintrayRepo("hmrc", "releases")

libraryDependencies += "uk.gov.hmrc" %% "play-ui" % "x.x.x"
```

If you require either [head](https://github.com/hmrc/play-ui/blob/master/src/main/twirl/uk/gov/hmrc/play/views/layouts/head.scala.html) or [footer](https://github.com/hmrc/play-ui/blob/master/src/main/twirl/uk/gov/hmrc/play/views/layouts/footer.scala.html) you'll also need to add some config to your `application.conf` file in order to build the complete urls for assets:

```
assets {
  version = "x.x.x"
  url = ""
}
```

### How to test changes locally

Publish the library locally with
 
 ```sbt clean compile publishLocal```
 
 This will build and install the library into your local Ivy cache. The final lines of the output will contain the version number. 
 
 Then update the configuration of your frontend application to use this version number. 
 This is in different files depending on the application. 
 In `business-tax-account`, it is in `FrontendBuild.scala`.
 In `one-time-password-frontend`, it is in `MicroServiceBuild.scala`.
 The line will look like 
 ```"uk.gov.hmrc" %% "play-ui" % "4.10"```
 
 now restart your frontend application, and you will see your local changes.
 
 n.b. you will need to run the sbt command to publish locally each time you make a change.
